// Using the different way of accessing and assigning a value to the object using `.` or `[]`

// 1. Define a variable named `user` and assign a blank object to it.
const user = {};

// 2. Add a key of `user name` and a value of `Black Panther` to that object.
user.userName = 'Black Panther';

// 3. Using `console.log` log the value of `user name` key from the user object.
console.log(user.userName);

// 4. Add a key of the value of variable `batch` in the object with the value of 10.
var batch = "myBatch";
user.batch = 10;

// 5. Using the alert function alert the value of the key added above.
for(let key in user) {
    alert(`${user[key]}`);
}

// 6. Add a key of `42` to the object with a value of `The answer to the meaning of life ðŸ§¸`.
user[42] =  `The answer to the meaning of life ðŸ§¸`;

// 7. Using the function console.log log the value of the key `42`.
console.log(user[42]);

// 8. Add a key in your object with the value of the variable `city`. The value of the key should be `true`.
var city = prompt("Enter the city name you visited las time.");
user.city = true;

// 9. Uisng console.log log the value of the key defined above.
for(let value in user) {
    console.log(`${user[value]}`);
}

// 10. Can you define a key of `let or var` in any object? Reason.
    `you could not use a variable as a property name inside an object literal. The only option you had was to create the object literal, assign the variable property name with value and pass the resulting object to the animate method. ES6 defines â€˜ComputedPropertyNameâ€™ as part of the grammar for object literals, which helps use a variable for a key. Object keys can be dynamically assigned in ES6 by placing an expression in square brackets.`
